Custom Fonts allows you to add more fonts that extend formatting options in your site.

== Description ==

This plugin helps you easily embed custom fonts files (woff2, woff, ttf, svg, eot, otf) easily in your WordPress website.

Currently, it works with:

* <a href="https://wpastra.com/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_campaign=custom-fonts&utm_medium=description">Astra Theme</a>
* <a href="https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/">Beaver Builder Theme</a>
* <a href="https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/">Beaver Builder Plugin</a>
* <a href="https://elementor.com/">Elementor Page Builder</a>

How does it work?

1. Install the plugin
2. Upload the font files in as many formats as possible for best browser compatibility.
3. And done. You will be able to see the fonts added in the settings of Astra / Beaver Builder / Elementor. Please refer screenshots.

If you're not using any of the supported plugins and theme, you can write the custom CSS to apply the fonts.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/custom-fonts` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Appearance -> Custom Fonts -> Add Custom Fonts name, woff2, woff, ttf, eot, otf and svg files.

== Screenshots ==

1. Add new custom font
2. Select your any custom font into the Customizer of Astra Theme
